# Email-Spam-Ham-Classifier-LR
Email Classifier: A machine learning project using Python that categorizes emails into spam and ham (non-spam). Utilizes the Scikit-Learn library, employing logistic regression and TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization for text analysis and classification.

This project used the "Email Dataset for Spam Detection" sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains a collection of emails labeled as spam and ham for training and testing the classifier.
